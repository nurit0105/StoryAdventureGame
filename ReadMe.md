The Player reads a text following different options, which creates the Players Story. To play the Game the Player must choose
one of the given options. 

Depending on the Options that the Player chooses the Game creates a different Graph which results in different endings. 

Inside the Game the Player can gain equipment and weapon as well as losing them. 
Along the way the Player will encounter different Non-playable-characters, Mini-Games and time-challenges.
