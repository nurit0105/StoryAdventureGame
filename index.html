        Welcome to the Gadventory - a platform for text-based Story-Adventure Games.
        This project is part of the seminar Software Engineering organized by the University of Applied Sciences “FH Campus Wien”.
        If you like "dungeons and dragons" or similar role playing games where your decisions determine your own story, this
        is the right place for you. We wish you a lot of fun playing!
